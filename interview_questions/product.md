If you were going to build an app for your C4Q class to help it run better and make it easier to learn:

1. How would you determine what to build?
2. What do you think the 3 most important features are, and why?
3. What feature would you build first and why?
4. Draw me a quick wireframe of the most important feature?
5. How would you determine after you released the app that you had built the right features and that people were using them as intended?
